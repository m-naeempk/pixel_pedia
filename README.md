# PixelPedia

PixelPedia is a mobile app designed to display images from a search term using a chosen image search API. The app features a custom spell checker to automatically correct user input mistakes, as well as a responsive image gallery for viewing search results.

## Features

- **Image Search:** The app allows users to enter a search term in a text entry field and request image results by tapping a "Search" icon. The application is using Pixabay image search API to fetch images.

- **Custom Spell Checker:** The app includes a custom spell checker that automatically corrects specific user input mistakes, such as:
  - Remove non-letter characters. `nyl;on` should auto-correct to `nylon`.
  - Mistyped vowels. `ceku` should auto-correct to `cake`.

- **Responsive Gallery:** The search results are displayed in a responsive gallery style. Users can scroll through the images to view the results conveniently.

- **Image Overlay:** Tapping on an image in the gallery will display it in a responsive overlay, allowing users to view the image in more detail.

  This feature ensures that users receive relevant image results even if they make spelling errors.

- **Error Handling:** The app includes error handling to provide a smooth user experience. It should gracefully handle network errors, API request failures, and other unexpected issues.

## Assumptions and Decisions

In the development of this app, the following assumptions and decisions have been made:

- **Spell Checker:** A custom spell checker is implemented to correct specific types of user input mistakes, as described in the project requirements. If there would be multiple possible words against a mistyped word, it would show all possibilities as suggestion. This feature enhances the user experience by ensuring that search results are relevant.

- **Algorithm:** Assuming in a spell checker, replacing vowels with vowels is the current algorithm. If the need arises to replace them with English alphabets, a single line in the `spellChecker.ts` must be modified.

   Replace `word = word.replace(/[aeiou]/g, '[aeiou]');` with `word = word.replace(/[aeiou]/g, '.');`
